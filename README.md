<h1> ABOUT ME </H1>
<hr>
<p>Hello, my name is Ediz D.
I am 16 years young and a passionate programmer. I started programming
with C++ and Python but now I am focusing on Java!<br> Most of my projects are
closed-source but in the near future I am going to
keep my focus also on open-source projects</p>
